selectors:


body, p : you can define the properties for the selectors and all the selectors will have the same property


classes:
defining styles for the classes helps to reuse the css whereever it is required.

ids:
styling using id can be very helpful for being very specific but it is not recommended to use id for styling because of its lack of reusuability






specicity hierarchy
Universal selector(*): 0, 0, 0, 0
Type selector(e.g., p, div, span): 0, 0, 0, 1
Class selector: 0, 0, 1, 0
Attribute selector: 0, 0, 1, 0
ID selector: 0, 1, 0, 0
Inline style: 1, 0, 0, 0



universal selector(*) does not follow inheritance, it simply selects every thing and applies the style.


form elements donot inherit the form settings.



"!important" tag is used to avoid the specificity rules and apply the style
