px is a absolute unit
1 rem = 16 px i.e rem is also absoulte units

em, % is relative units, it takes the parent size and multiply it

it is not recommended to use em because if some where in the css, the parent size is defined, then it herits the parent element size and multiplies it.

it is better to use "em" when it herits its own size.


ch : ch is a character, used to define the width, etc


vw : viewport width = 1% of view port width
vh: viewport height = 1% of view port height

when defining the width in the body it is recommended to use % instead of vw
and giving min-height : 100vh is recommended
